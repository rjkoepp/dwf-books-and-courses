Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more
shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the $n$th
column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very
long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column. <BibRef id='KR1988' pages='p. 34'></BibRef>
